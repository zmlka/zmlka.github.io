This is brief recollection in essay form of a short presentation that I gave
on Thursday, October 18th at the kick off session of the
[ATRAP](http://www.atrap.org) architecture text reading group. The main aim was
to show that reading historical documents (not history books) has merit for
designers. For the sake of brevity, the presentation only contained four key
reasons.

## History Repeats Itself

An almost immediate realisation that comes to somebody who reads both
historical documents and history books is that history repeats itself. This is
not meant to indicate that the world is floating along some sort of sine curve
where we return to the same value every now and then, but it is to say that
the same questions and conundrums do show up in human thought at a surprisingly
high frequency.

Note the word ‘human’ in the previous sentence, as this is a key point. What we
will be reading and discussing is historical documents, which are, by
definition, outputs of humans. And it is human output, thought and discourse
that the statement ‘history repeats itself’ is referring to. Throughout the
year, as we progress through 20th century thought it will become prominent that
there are certain fundamental questions and oppositions that have still not been
answered or resolved, and keep on popping up. For an architect, or anybody
exercising creativity by answering questions and problems awareness of
precedence is critical.

It is precisely because history repeats itself that it is worthwhile to study it,
since if history repeats itself it means that historical documents are still
relevant to us in the present. Reading the thoughts and opinions of others
allows us to understand their decision making, and use it to reflect on our
own. Were it the case that historical opinions were irrelevant, there would be
a minimum to gain from them from the designer. At least for architectural
thought, it can still be said that much of what has happened in the past 100
years is still relatable and fresh.

Of course, there is a danger to interpreting documents. Perhaps even stronger than our
ability to repeat the thoughts of our predecessors is our ability to
pattern-match. Statistically speaking, given a large enough volume of material
we can conjure up all sorts meaning from it, all sorts of patterns, metaphors,
predictions and the like (for example, analysing [Moby
Dick](http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/moby.html) for assassinations). We are
all familiar with these sorts of statements, statements along the lines of “the
Egyptians predicted the iPad” by writing on erasable stone tablets or something
along these lines. Therefore, it must be kept in mind that were are reading
history not to speculate about the past, but to use it to reflect on the
present. 

The very fact that certain debates in all fields of design have been going on
for hundreds of years in slight variations is both comforting and disturbing,
and it is an awareness of these debates and their development through history
that might allow us to progress beyond them.

## History Books Lie

The question can be asked: “why read historical documents when I can just read
a history book?”

The answer is two fold.

Firstly, because as what was indicated in the fourth paragraph of the prior
section, that as designers we are not interested in learning history, but in
learning what the past can make us realise about the present, and more
specifically, what it can do to adjust, clarify and progress our design in the
present. In this sense, for the purposes of the reading group, reading is a
means to an end, the end being better designer. Therefore, books that are
written to primarily to fact load the reader about history (ie: books that are
a means to the end of learning facts) are irrelevant to us.

The second, and more profound reason, is that history books lie. Any attempt to
recall something, to reword something will always have some trace of the agent
doing the retelling. In some cases, this can be quite deliberate, but even in
situations where the raconteur strives for «objectivity» they end up making
decisions, decisions which will reflect what they perceive to be important, and
in turn reflecting their value judgement. There are many ways to spin a story,
and a text that recalls events has to choose one of them.

If we are interested in the thoughts and opinions of architects, it is their
writing that must be read, not a retrospective interpretation of their work by
somebody writing a general, politicised history book. This is the most direct
and honest manner in which we can find out the reasoning behind their
decisions. In a linear medium such as writing, things are explained – which is
something that can not be said about pictures, plans or drawings.

## Awareness of Decisions

Or, to put it another way: “because ‘I did it because I like it’ is
inadequate”.

Reading the reasoning process behind the designs of others makes us consider our
own design. It quickly becomes incredibly obvious that there is frequently a
very concrete motive for the way things look, especially when it comes to the
designs of those who made some sort of breakthrough. It also makes us realise
that not only do different people answer the same question differently, but even
if their thinking is very close they might come out with a completely different
aesthetic representation of that thought due to their particular situation and
context.

Seeing Frank Lloyd Wright (or anyone else for that matter) explain his
buildings by outlining and justifying the underlying principles is an
experience that transforms one's understanding of how a design can come
together. Quite possibly, from that point on, you will think that all design
decisions must undergo the same level of scrutiny.

Suddenly, designers will not just be visual references (“I like their style”)
but instead will be reference points to certain paradigmatic views of the world
(“I can relate to their world view”).

## Awareness of Impact

An architect's work will be interpreted. The subject of interpretation
might be under their control, but not by whom the interpretation will be made
or the result of the interpretation.

Because an architect's work will the subject of hermeneutic acts, it more than
makes sense for the architect to be aware of what their result might be.

Simply put, if an architect is not aware of, and doesn't at least somehow cater
to, the common understanding of architectural contexts, their work will lose
its ability to be understood outside of the architect's own mind. Perhaps even
worse than not being understood is the possibility of being misunderstood.
There are certain things which, to the architectural audience, will always send
certain messages. That is not to say that an architectural work must be part of
some continuity or must employ certain tropes to be «great», on the contrary.
It is quite possible that a design does not use or consider any aesthetic or
historical factors, but the very fact that the result of architecture is
something both ambiguous and something that is not able to defend itself by
being responsive; means that the interpretation of a work will always rely, to
some degree, on what its interpreter knows.

For example, if a building has a duck on it that is a very specific
reference in the world of architecture, and if one is not aware of the reference
and incorporates a duck into their design it could lead to uncomfortably
hilarious situations.

Awareness of history allows designers to understand the context within which
their work will be understood, and ultimately the impact that their work might
have on its users and interpreters. Observers attach meaning to something from
their observations, and those observations are interpreted through their
understanding of the world. Know your audience.
