“Chilli on ice cream is a documentary-artistic publication that presents
material created during a two month trip across Mexico in the summer of 2013.
It presents paintings, aquarells, photographs and texts.”

Such is the blurb on the back of the book, for which I did the editing and
templating. It should also be said that the events chronicled and presented in
the book led to an exhibition in Culiacán, so it also serves as a bit of a
post-factum exhibition catalogue.


A tri-lingual publication supported by the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague.
