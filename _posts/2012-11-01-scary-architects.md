A piece written for the [Scary Architects
issue](http://www.sanrocco.info/05_scaryarchitects.html) of San Rocco magazine.
In a less than serious manner, it goes on a thought that what is really scary
is not scary individuals that practice, but those individuals that shape their
ideology, as the ideology shapers are a much more difficult target to aim for.
An example of such a demagogue would be Karel Teige, who had a lot to say about
how architecture should be.

San Rocco describes itself as “a magazine written by architects. As such, San
Rocco is not particularly intelligent, or philosophically accurate.”
